The Python code examples provided follow object-oriented design principles well, especially the SOLID principles. Each class and function has a specific job, sticking to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). For instance, the Person class handles a person's name and age, the calculate_total function figures out the total cost of items in a cart, and the mark_attendance method in the Student class takes care of attendance. This method makes the codebase easier to grasp and maintain since each part deals with just one function. Inheritance is used correctly, like the Car subclass inheriting from the Vehicle class, showing the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). This means that Car instances can be swapped with Vehicle instances without messing up the program. This design encourages code reuse and expansion, allowing new subclasses to be added without changing existing code. The code also demonstrates encapsulation, with methods and attributes properly enclosed within classes. For example, the Computer class holds info about a computer's brand, model, RAM, and storage, offering methods to upgrade RAM and storage. This encapsulation hides the inner workings of the class, making it easier to maintain and reducing the risk of unintended side effects when the class is altered. While interfaces are not explicitly shown in the examples, they generally follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by making sure classes only rely on the methods they need. This helps avoid unnecessary dependencies and makes the system more adaptable to changes in requirements.
In general, the code examples demonstrate effective design practices that encourage easy maintenance, flexibility, and reuse. By adhering to these principles, the codebase becomes stronger and simpler to manage, allowing for seamless integration of future modifications and improvements.
