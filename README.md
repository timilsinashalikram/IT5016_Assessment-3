# IT5016_Assessment-3       
Welcome to my IT5016 Assessment 3 repository!
In this repository, I have gathered a variety of code examples that demonstrate my growth and expertise in programming. The repository is divided into two primary sections:  

#Collection of Own Codes                                                                                                                In this folder, you'll find five codes that I completed before this project. These codes represent my foundational understanding of programming concepts and demonstrate my early coding endeavors. They serve as a benchmark of my skills prior to undertaking this assessment. 

#Collection of Inspired Codes                                                                                                       Inside this folder, you will discover five codes that I finished prior to starting this project. These codes showcase my basic grasp of programming principles and show my initial coding efforts. They act as a reference point for my abilities before beginning this evaluation. 

#Design Principles                                                                                                                      In the file called "design principles," I discuss how the SOLID design principle is relevant to the codes in both collections. This gives a glimpse into my thinking and approach to creating strong and easy-to-manage code.
